  Welcome to Meow, A modal editing in Emacs.

  In this tutorial we will walk through the basic concepts, modes and commands.
Before we start, I recommend you save your works.

  About 10 minutes is required to finish the tutorial, and don't be panic, you can quit at any time.

  Meow is activated and we are in NORMAL mode!

  You may notice almost every single keys have no bounded command. This is because Meow has no opinion for command layout. We have to build our own layout. We use `meow-normal-define-key' to bind command for NORMAL mode.

  At the moment, we can still use vanilla Emacs command to move around and execute commands. But we need a way to ENTER INSERT mode, so we can type. Evaluate the following expression with C-x C-e or C-M-x.

(meow-normal-define-key
  '(\"i\" . meow-insert)
  '(\"I\" . meow-open-above)
  '(\"a\" . meow-append)
  '(\"A\" . meow-open-below))

  Now, we can enter INSERT mode with i, a, I or A.

(You don't have to copy these codes to configuration, the decision you made will be collected at the end of this tutorial.)

  I guess you are eager to have basic movement keybindings.

(meow-normal-define-key
  '(\"h\" . meow-left)
  '(\"H\" . meow-left-expand)
  '(\"j\" . meow-next)
  '(\"J\" . meow-next-expand)
  '(\"k\" . meow-prev)
  '(\"K\" . meow-prev-expand)
  '(\"l\" . meow-right)
  '(\"L\" . meow-right-expand))

  (You may want to tweak a little bit if you are not on Qwerty keyboard layout.)

  Now we have basic 4 direction movements, those with upper cases will expand selection(or called region). In Meow, selection has a type and it is one part of the core concept in Meow.

  A selection type can be described as (expand/select . THING). For example, `meow-next-expand' will start a selection, and its type is described as (expand . char). You can check with M-: (meow--selection-type). The expand means the selection can be extended with commands those have a same THING property. So the selection started with `meow-next-expand' can be expanded by all these charactor movements.

Try with `meow-right-expand', `meow-right', `meow-right', `meow-right', ...

  Motion and selection are usually combined together.

  Let's introduce some commands for word and symbols.

(meow-normal-define-key
  '(\"b\" . meow-back-word)
  '(\"B\" . meow-back-symbol)
  '(\"e\" . meow-next-word)
  '(\"E\" . meow-next-symbol)
  '(\"w\" . meow-mark-word)
  '(\"W\" . meow-mark-symbol))

  Things are getting interesting, because these commands are not those we familiar in Vim. `meow-back-*' and `meow-next-*' will make a selection of type (select . word). The select means the selection will not be expanded when you give it a command with same THING. so these command will not expand for each other or themselves.

  But `meow-mark-*' command will create a selection with type (expand . word). So it can be your start point if you want select a few words or symbols. You may notice some overlay hints show you the count of occurs for what you select with `meow-mark-*'. We will explain how it works in next page.

  In these page, we talk about searching. Binding the following commands according to your preferences.

(meow-normal-define-key
  '(\"v\" . meow-visit)
  '(\"n\" . meow-search)
  '(\"N\" . meow-pop-search)
  '(\";\" . meow-reverse))

  In Emacs, `regexp-search-ring' is used to store your searching histories. In Meow, there are 4 commands will commit a regexp into the ring, they are: `meow-mark-word', `meow-mark-symbol', `meow-visit' and `meow-search'.

  We already seen how `meow-mark-*' works, let's introduce `meow-visit'. You can use `meow-visit' for a quick symbol searching, a completion is provided to make things easier.

  To search continuously, we need to talk about `meow-search'. There are some rules to help understanding:
  1. `meow-search' will read the car of `regexp-search-ring', if current search is not match current selection, the content of current selection will be added into `regexp-search-ring'.
  2. `meow-search' will search according to the car of `regexp-search-ring'.
  3. The search direction of `meow-search' is controlled by the direction of selection.

  How to change this   "[quit]

(meow-normal-define-key
  '(\"u\" . meow-undo)dn faksdfjasdhlfhb bljbl
bl
  '(\"p\" . meow-yank)
  '(\"p\" . meow-yank-pop)
  '(\"s\" . meow-kill)
  '(\"S\" . meow-kill-append)
  '(\"y\" . meow-save)
  '(\"Y\" . meow-save-append)
  '(\"r\" . meow-replace)
  '(\"R\" . meow-replace-save))

  You may have confusions here, let me explain.

  `meow-undo' is similar to `undo', but will always cancel the selection first. So with `meow-undo', we don't have to care about whether we have a selection or note. If we want to undo in selection, use `meow-undo-in-selection'.

  `meow-kill-append' and `meow-save-append' will append to current kill instead of inserting a new one to kill-ring.

  `meow-replace' will replace current selection with current kill, and `meow-replace-save' will exchange them.
